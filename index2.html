    <h3>Diversity Scholarships</h3>
    <p>
      To help us expand our diversity scholarship program, 
      this year we have added Community Tickets. 
      Priced slightly higher than our normal tickets, these provide partial funding for our diversity scholarship program.
      For each one sold, Frontrunners will also award a free ticket to one of our diversity scholarship applicants. 
      Diversity scholarships are available to members of communities typically underrepresented in tech. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please consider purchasing a community ticket, instead of a normal ticket, especially if your company is buying your ticket for you, 
      and help us expand the tech community.
    </p>
    <p>
      To apply for a diversity scholarship simply fill out an

      today!
      We will close this application on Feb 12th.
