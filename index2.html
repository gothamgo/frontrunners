    <p>
      Unfortunately, our original CFP service is apparently no longer maintained! We can't use it to contact and confirm speakers!
      Therefore, we opened up another CFP while we try to reach out in other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, to make this manageable, we have decided to concentrate on AI/Data content for this Frontrunners.
      We apologize to the considerable number of people who have submitted JS/Web talks.
    </p>
